train  Treatment Response Alignment Model (TRAM) Matlab implementation

This is the Matlab implementation for the paper "Alignment and Classification 
of Time Series Gene Expression in Clinical Studies" by Lin, Kaminski, 
and Bar-Joseph.

The training and predicting functions are tramGenTrain, tramDiscTrain, and 
tramPredict. To learn a HMM using generative training, call

>> model = tramGenTrain(trainData, nState, ...);

For input data format, options, and model data structure, type 
"help tramGenTrain" in Matlab. 
To optimize a generatively trained HMM using discriminative training, call

>> model = tramDiscTrain(trainData, model, ...);

To classify new data based on the learned model, call

>> logOdds = tramPredict(testData, model, ...);

Positive values in logOdds denote the second class, while negative values 
denote the first class. Type "help tramGenTrain" and "help tramClassify" for 
more details.

See tramQuickExample for a quick example (taking less than 3 minutes), or 
tramExample for an example of training and testing on simulated data with 
parameters used in the paper (taking about 45 minutes).
